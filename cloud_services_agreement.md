# Cloud Service Agreement

# 1. **Service** 

## 1.1 Access and Use<. During the **Subscription** **Period**, **Customer** may (a) access and use the Cloud Service; and (b) copy and use the included Software and Documentation only as needed to access and use the Cloud Service, in each case, for its internal business purposes and only if **Customer** complies with the terms of this Agreement. 

## <u>Service Level</u>. If there is an **SLA** and the Cloud Service does not meet the **SLA**, **Provider** will provide the remedies outlined in the **SLA** and will not be responsible for any other remedies. Any credits earned under the **SLA** will only apply to future invoices and expire if the Agreement ends. In any event, if the Cloud Service is temporarily unavailable for scheduled maintenance, for unscheduled emergency maintenance, or because of other causes beyond **Provider’s** reasonable control, no **SLA** remedies will accrue. **Provider** will try to inform **Customer** before scheduled service disruptions through the Cloud Service or by email.

## <u>Support</u>. During the **Subscription Period**, **Provider** will provide technical support to ensure **Customer** can successfully use Cloud Service.

## <u>User Accounts</u>. **Customer** is responsible for all actions on Users’ accounts and for Users’ compliance with this Agreement. **Customer** and Users must protect the confidentiality of their passwords and login credentials. **Customer** will promptly notify **Provider** if it suspects or knows of any fraudulent activity with its accounts, passwords, or credentials, or if they become compromised. 

## <u>Feedback and Usage Data</u>. **Customer** may, but is not required to, give **Provider** Feedback, in which case **Customer** gives Feedback “AS IS”. **Provider** may use all Feedback freely without any restriction or obligation. In addition, **Provider** may collect and analyze Usage Data, and **Provider** may freely use Usage Data to maintain, improve, and enhance **Provider’s** products and services without restriction or obligation. However, **Provider** may only share Usage Data with others if the Usage Data is aggregated and does not identify **Customer** or Users.

## <u>Customer Content</u>. **Provider** may copy, display, modify, and use Customer Content only as needed to provide and maintain the Product and related offerings. **Customer** is responsible for the accuracy and content of Customer Content. 

# **Restrictions & Obligations**

## <u>Restrictions on Customer</u>. 

### Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, **Customer** will not (and will not allow any anyone else to): (i) reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to discover any source code or underlying ideas or algorithms of the Product (except to the extent Applicable Laws prohibit this restriction); (ii) provide, sell, transfer, sublicense, lend, distribute, rent, or otherwise allow others to access or use the Product; (iii) remove any proprietary notices or labels; (iv) copy, modify, or create derivative works of the Product; (v) conduct security or vulnerability tests on, interfere with the operation of, cause performance degradation of, or circumvent access restrictions of the Product; (vi) access accounts, information, data, or portions of the Product to which **Customer** does not have explicit authorization; (vii) use the Product to develop a competing service or product; (viii) use the Product with any High Risk Activities or with activity prohibited by Applicable Laws; (ix) use the Product to obtain unauthorized access to anyone else’s networks or equipment; or (x) upload, submit, or otherwise make available to the Product any Customer Content to which **Customer** and Users do not have the proper rights.

### **Customer’s** use of the Product must comply with all Documentation and the **Acceptable Use Policy**, if any.

## <u>Suspension</u>. If **Customer** (a) has an outstanding, undisputed balance on its account for more than 30 days after the **Payment Period**; (b) breaches Section 2.1 (Restrictions on Customer); or (c) uses the Product in violation of the Agreement or in a way that materially and negatively impacts the Product or others, then **Provider** may temporarily suspend **Customer’s** access to the Product with or without notice. However, **Provider** will try to inform **Customer** before suspending **Customer’s** account when practical. **Provider** will reinstate **Customer’s** access to the Product only if **Customer** resolves the underlying issue.

# **Professional Services**

## **Provider** will perform the **Professional Services** as detailed in a Cover Page, if any, and **Customer** will reasonably cooperate with **Provider** to allow the performance of **Professional Services**, including providing Customer Content as needed. **Provider** is not responsible for any inability to perform the **Professional Services** if **Customer** does not cooperate as reasonably requested. 

# **Privacy & Security**

## <u>Personal Data</u>. Before submitting Personal Data governed by GDPR, **Customer** must enter into a data processing agreement with **Provider**. If the parties have a **DPA**, the terms of the **DPA** will control each party’s rights and obligations as to Personal Data and the terms of the **DPA** will control in the event of any conflict with this Agreement. 

## <u>Prohibited Data</u>. **Customer** will not (and will not allow anyone else to) submit Prohibited Data to the Product unless authorized by the Cover Page.

## <u>Security</u>. **Provider** will comply with the **Security Policy**, if any. 

# **Payment & Taxes**

## <u>Fees and Invoices</u>. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are exclusive of taxes. Except for the prorated refund of prepaid fees allowed with specific termination rights, fees are non-refundable. **Provider** will send invoices for fees applicable to the Product once per **Invoice Period** in advance starting on the **Subscription Start Date**. Invoices for **Professional Services** may be sent monthly during performance of the **Professional Services** unless the Cover Page includes a different cadence. 

## <u>Payment</u>. **Customer** will pay **Provider** the fees and taxes in each invoice in U.S. Dollars within the **Payment Period**. 

## <u>Taxes</u>. **Customer** is responsible for all duties, taxes, and levies that apply to fees, including sales, use, VAT, GST, or withholding, that **Provider** itemizes and includes in an invoice. However, **Customer** is not responsible for **Provider’s** income taxes.

## <u>Payment Dispute</u>. If **Customer** has a good-faith disagreement about the amounts charged on an invoice, **Customer** must notify **Provider** about the dispute during the **Payment Period** for the invoice and must pay all undisputed amounts on time. The parties will work together to resolve the dispute within 15 days after the end of the **Payment Period**. If no resolution is agreed, each party may pursue any remedies available under the Agreement or Applicable Laws.

# **Term & Termination**

## <u>Subscription Period</u>. Each Order Form will start on the **Subscription Start Date**, continue for the **Subscription Period**, and automatically renew for additional **Subscription Periods** unless one party gives notice of non-renewal to the other party before the **Non-Renewal Notice Date**. 

## <u>Agreement Term</u>. This Agreement will start on the **Effective Date** and continue for the longer of one year or until all **Subscription Periods** have ended.

In addition, either party may terminate an affected Order Form if a Force Majeure Event prevents the Product from materially operating for 30 or more consecutive days, and **Provider** will pay to **Customer** a prorated refund of prepaid fees for the remainder of the **Subscription Period**. A party must notify the other of its reason for termination.

## <u>Effect of Termination</u>. Termination of the Agreement will automatically terminate all Order Forms. Upon expiration or termination:

### **Customer** will no longer have any right to use the Product, **Technical Support**, or **Professional Services**.

### Upon **Customer’s** request, **Provider** will delete Customer Content within 60 days.

### Each Recipient will return or destroy Discloser’s Confidential Information in its possession or control.

### **Provider** will submit a final invoice for all outstanding fees accrued before termination and **Customer** will pay the invoice according to Section 5 (Payment & Taxes).

# **Representations & Warranties**

## <u>Mutual</u>. Each party represents and warrants to the other that: (a) it has the legal power and authority to enter into this Agreement; (b) it is duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Applicable Laws of the jurisdiction of its origin; (c) it will comply with all Applicable Laws in performing its obligations or exercising its rights in this Agreement; and (d) it will comply with the **Additional Warranties**.

## <u>From Customer</u>. **Customer** represents and warrants that it, all Users, and anyone submitting Customer Content each have and will continue to have all rights necessary to submit or make available Customer Content to the Product and to allow the use of Customer Content as described in the Agreement.

## <u>From Provider</u>. **Provider** represents and warrants to **Customer** that (a) it will not materially reduce the general functionality of the Cloud Service during a **Subscription Period**; and (b) it will perform **Professional Services** in a competent and professional manner.

## <u>Provider Warranty Remedy</u>. If **Provider** breaches a warranty in Section 7.3, **Customer** must give **Provider** notice (with enough detail for **Provider** to understand or replicate the issue) within 45 days of discovering the issue. Within 45 days of receiving sufficient details of the warranty issue, **Provider** will attempt to restore the general functionality of the Cloud Service or reperform the **Professional Services**. If **Provider** cannot resolve the issue, **Customer** may terminate the affected Order Form and **Provider** will pay to **Customer** a prorated refund of prepaid fees for the remainder of the **Subscription Period**. **Provider’s** restoration and reperformance obligations, and **Customer’s** termination right, are **Customer’s** only remedies if **Provider** does not meet the warranties in Section 7.3.

# **Disclaimer of Warranties**

## **Provider** makes no guarantees that the Product will always be safe, secure, or error-free, or that it will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. The warranties in Section 7.3 do not apply to any misuse or unauthorized modification of the Product, nor to any product or service provided by anyone other than **Provider**. Except for the warranties in Section 7, **Provider** and **Customer** each **disclaim all other warranties, whether express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement**. These disclaimers apply to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Laws.

# **Limitation of Liability**

## <u>Liability Caps</u>. **Each party’s total cumulative liability for all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement will not be more than the General Cap Amount.**

## <u>Damages Waiver</u>. **Each party’s liability for any claim or liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws. Under no circumstances will either party be liable to the other for lost profits or revenues, or for consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages relating to this Agreement, even if the party is informed of the possibility of this type of damage in advance.**

# **Indemnification**

## <u>Protection by Provider</u>. **Provider** will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless **Customer** from and against all **Provider Covered Claims** made by someone other than **Customer**, **Customer’s** Affiliates, or Users, and all out-of-pocket damages, awards, settlements, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, that arise from the **Provider Covered Claim**.

## <u>Protection by Customer</u>. **Customer** will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless **Provider** from and against all **Customer Covered Claims** made by someone other than **Provider** or its Affiliates, and all out-of-pocket damages, awards, settlements, costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, that arise from the **Customer Covered Claim**.

## <u>Procedure</u>. The Indemnifying Party’s obligations in this section are contingent upon the Protected Party: (a) promptly notifying the Indemnifying Party of each Covered Claim for which it seeks protection; (b) providing reasonable assistance to the Indemnifying Party at the Indemnifying Party’s expense; and (c) giving the Indemnifying Party sole control over the defense and settlement of each Covered Claim. A Protected Party may participate in a Covered Claim for which it seeks protection with its own attorneys only at its own expense. The Indemnifying Party may not agree to any settlement of a Covered Claim that contains an admission of fault or otherwise materially and adversely impacts the Protected Party without the prior written consent of the Protected Party. 

## <u>Changes to Product</u>. If required by settlement or court order, or if deemed reasonably necessary in response to a **Provider Covered Claim**, **Provider** may: (a) obtain the right for **Customer** to continue using the Product; (b) replace or modify the affected component of the Product without materially reducing the general functionality of the Product; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) are reasonable, terminate the affected Order Form and issue a pro-rated refund of prepaid fees for the remainder of the **Subscription Period**.

## <u>Exclusions</u>. 

### **Provider’s** obligations as an Indemnifying Party will not apply to **Provider Covered Claims** that result from (i) modifications to the Product that were not authorized by **Provider** or that were made in compliance with **Customer’s** instructions; (ii) unauthorized use of the Product, including use in violation of this Agreement; (iii) use of the Product in combination with items not provided by **Provider**; or (iv) use of an old version of the Product where a newer release would avoid the **Provider Covered Claim**.

### **Customer’s** obligations as an Indemnifying Party will not apply to **Customer Covered Claims** that result from the unauthorized use of the **Customer Content**, including use in violation of this Agreement.

## <u>Exclusive Remedy</u>. This Section 10 (Indemnification), together with any termination rights, describes each Protected Party’s exclusive remedy and each Indemnifying Party’s entire liability for a Covered Claim.

# **Confidentiality**

## <u>Non-Use and Non-Disclosure</u>. Unless otherwise authorized in the Agreement, Recipient will (a) only use Discloser’s Confidential Information to fulfill its obligations or exercise its rights under this Agreement; and (b) not disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to anyone else. In addition, Recipient will protect Discloser’s Confidential Information using at least the same protections Recipient uses for its own similar information but no less than a reasonable standard of care.

## <u>Exclusions</u>. Confidential Information does not include information that (a) Recipient knew without any obligation of confidentiality before disclosure by Discloser; (b) is or becomes publicly known and generally available through no fault of Recipient; (c) Recipient receives under no obligation of confidentiality from someone else who is authorized to make the disclosure; or (d) Recipient independently developed without use of or reference to Discloser’s Confidential Information.

## <u>Required Disclosures</u>. Recipient may disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to the extent required by Applicable Laws if, unless prohibited by Applicable Laws, Recipient provides the Disclosing Party reasonable advance notice of the required disclosure and reasonably cooperates, at the Discloser’s expense, with the Discloser’s efforts to obtain confidential treatment for the Confidential Information. 

## <u>Permitted Disclosures</u>. Recipient may disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to Users, employees, advisors, contractors, and representatives who each have a need to know the Confidential Information, but only if the person or entity is bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those in this Section 11 and Recipient remains responsible for everyone’s compliance with the terms of this Section 11.

# **Reservation of Rights**

## Except for the limited license to copy and use Software and Documentation in Section 1.1 (Access and Use), **Provider** retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Product, whether developed before or after the **Effective Date**. Except for the limited rights in Section 1.7 (Customer Content), **Customer** retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Customer Content.

# **General Terms**

## <u>Entire Agreement</u>. This Agreement is the only agreement between the parties about its subject and this Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous statements (whether in writing or not) about its subject. **Provider** expressly rejects any terms included in **Customer’s** purchase order or similar document, which may only be used for accounting or administrative purposes. 

## <u>Modifications, Severability, and Waiver</u>. Any waiver, modification, or change to the Agreement must be in writing and signed or electronically accepted by each party. However, **Provider** may update **Technical Support**, the **SLA**, the **Security Policy**, or the **Acceptable Use Policy** by giving **Customer** 30 days prior notice. During the 30-day notice period, **Customer** may terminate the Agreement or affected Order Form upon notice if the update is a material reduction from the prior version and Provider cannot reasonably restore the prior version or a comparable alternative. If any term of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a relevant court or governing body, the remaining terms of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The failure of a party to enforce a term or to exercise an option or right in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver by that party of the term, option, or right.

## <u>Governing Law and Chosen Courts</u>. The **Governing Law** will govern all interpretations and disputes about this Agreement, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The parties will bring any legal suit, action, or proceeding about this Agreement in the **Chosen Courts** and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the **Chosen Courts**.

## <u>Injunctive Relief</u>. Despite Section 14.3 (Governing Law and Chosen Courts), a breach of Section 11 (Confidentiality) or the violation of a party’s intellectual property rights may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages cannot adequately compensate. As a result, upon the actual or threatened breach of Section 11 (Confidentiality) or violation of a party’s intellectual property rights, the non-breaching or non-violating party may seek appropriate equitable relief, including an injunction, in any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post a bond and without limiting its other rights or remedies.

## <u>Non-Exhaustive Remedies</u>. Except where the Agreement provides for an exclusive remedy, seeking or exercising a remedy does not limit the other rights or remedies available to a party.

## <u>Assignment</u>. Neither party may assign any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. However, either party may assign this Agreement upon notice if the assigning party undergoes a merger, change of control, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all its equity, business, or assets to which this Agreement relates. Any attempted but non-permitted assignment is void. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.

## <u>No Publicity</u>. Neither party may publicly announce the existence of this Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.

## <u>Notices</u>. Any notice, request, or approval about the Agreement must be in writing and sent to the **Notice Address**. Notices will be deemed given (a) upon confirmed delivery if by email, registered or certified mail, or personal delivery; or (b) two days after mailing if by overnight commercial delivery.

## <u>Independent Contractors</u>. The parties are independent contractors, not agents, partners, or joint venturers. Neither party is authorized to bind the other to any liability or obligation. 

## <u>No Third-Party Beneficiary</u>. There are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

## <u>Force Majeure</u>. Neither party will be liable for a delay or failure to perform its obligations of this Agreement if caused by a Force Majeure Event. However, this section does not excuse **Customer’s** obligations to pay fees. 

## <u>Export Controls</u>. **Customer** may not remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of the Product or any related technology or materials in violation of any restrictions, laws, or regulations of the United States Department of Commerce, the United States Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control, or any other United States or foreign agency or authority. 

## <u>Government Rights</u>. The Cloud Service and Software are deemed “commercial items” or “commercial computer software” according to FAR section 12.212 and DFAR section 227.7202, and the Documentation is “commercial computer software documentation” according to DFAR section 252.227-7014(a)(1) and (5). Any use, modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the Product by the U.S. Government will be governed solely by the terms of this Agreement and all other use is prohibited. 

## <u>Anti-Bribery</u>. Neither party will take any action that would be a violation of any Applicable Laws that prohibit the offering, giving, promising to offer or give, or receiving, directly or indirectly, money or anything of value to any third party to assist **Provider** or **Customer** in retaining or obtaining business. Examples of these kinds of laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.

## <u>Titles and Interpretation</u>. Section titles are for convenience and reference only. All uses of “including” and similar phrases are non-exhaustive and without limitation. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act do not apply to this Agreement.

## <u>Signature</u>. This Agreement may be signed in counterparts, including by electronic copies or acceptance mechanism. Each copy will be deemed an original and all copies, when taken together, will be the same agreement.

# Service Level Agreement

# **Uptime** 

## <u>Target Uptime</u>. **Provider** will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Cloud Service available for at least the **Target Uptime** as calculated each calendar month. 

## <u>Uptime Calculation</u>. **Provider** and **Customer** agree to calculate availability of the Cloud Service as the total number of Available Minutes minus the number of Downtime Minutes, divided by the total number of Available Minutes, measured in a calendar month. If the **Subscription Period** includes a partial month, the numerator and denominator will only include the days that are part of the **Subscription Period** for that month. 

## <u>Scheduling Downtime</u>. If **Provider** does not notify **Customer** about Scheduled Downtime before the **Maintenance** **Notification** **Time**, that period of unavailability will not qualify as Scheduled Downtime and will count as Downtime Minutes. **Provider** may notify **Customer** about Scheduled Downtime by electronic means, including by email, on the Cloud Service, or on **Provider’s** website.

# **Remedies**

## <u>Service Credit</u>. If Cloud Service availability falls below the **Target Uptime**, **Customer** is eligible to receive a **Service Credit**. **Service Credits** only apply towards future Cloud Service fees owed by **Customer** to **Provider** 

## <u>Requesting A Service Credit</u>. To receive a **Service Credit**, **Customer** must notify **Provider** within 7 days of the end of the month where **Customer** experienced Cloud Service unavailability, otherwise **Service Credit** eligibility will expire for that month. **Customer** must include information about when it was unable to access the Cloud Service and may be required to provide additional details about its attempts to access the Cloud Service. If **Provider** can verify Cloud Service unavailability in its internal monitoring systems and the disruption does not qualify as Excluded Minutes or Scheduled Downtime, **Provider** will calculate and issue the applicable **Service Credit** on **Customer’s** account to apply towards a future invoice. 

## <u>Service Credit Limitations</u>. **Service** **Credits** may not be exchanged for, or converted to, monetary amounts. **Service** **Credits** do not earn interest. **Service** **Credits** will not accumulate within a single **Subscription** **Period** in an amount more than 1 months’ worth of Cloud Service fees. However, for **Invoice** **Periods** shorter than one year, **Service** **Credits** will not accumulate within an **Invoice Period** in an amount more than 5% of the Cloud Service fees in that **Invoice Period**. 

## <u>Termination</u>. If the Cloud Service does not meet the **Target** **Uptime** for two (2) out of any three (3) consecutive months and **Customer** notified **Provider** of the failures within 7 days of the end of each impacted month, **Customer** may immediately terminate the affected Order Form by giving written notice to **Provider**. If **Customer** terminates an Order Form under this section, **Provider** will pay to **Customer** a prorated refund of prepaid fees for the remainder of the **Subscription** **Period**.

## <u>Exclusive Remedy</u>. This SLA describes **Customer’s** exclusive remedy and **Provider’s** entire liability for any failure of the Cloud Service to meet the **Target** **Uptime**.
