If **Provider** breaches a warranty in Section 7.3, **Customer** must give **Provider** notice (with enough detail for **Provider** to understand or replicate the issue) within 45 days of discovering the issue. Within 45 days of receiving sufficient details of the warranty issue, **Provider** will attempt to restore the general functionality of the Cloud Service or reperform the **Professional Services**.

## 11.4 Permitted Disclosures. 
Recipient may disclose Discloser’s Confidential Information to Users, employees, advisors, contractors, and representatives who each have a need to know the Confidential Information, but only if the person or entity is bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those in this Section 11 and Recipient remains responsible for everyone’s compliance with the terms of this Section 11.

# 12. **Reservation of Rights**

Except for the limited license to copy and use Software and Documentation in Section 1.1 (Access and Use), **Provider** retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Product, whether developed before or after the **Effective Date**. Except for the limited rights in Section 1.7 (Customer Content), **Customer** retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Customer Content.

# 13. **General Terms**

## 13.1 Entire Agreement. 
This Agreement is the only agreement between the parties about its subject and this Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous statements (whether in writing or not) about its subject. **Provider** expressly rejects any terms included in **Customer’s** purchase order or similar document, which may only be used for accounting or administrative purposes. 

## 13.2 Modifications, Severability, and Waiver. 
Any waiver, modification, or change to the Agreement must be in writing and signed or electronically accepted by each party.

During the 30-day notice period, **Customer** may terminate the Agreement or affected Order Form upon notice if the update is a material reduction from the prior version and Provider cannot reasonably restore the prior version or a comparable alternative. If any term of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a relevant court or governing body, the remaining terms of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The failure of a party to enforce a term or to exercise an option or right in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver by that party of the term, option, or right.

The **Governing Law** will govern all interpretations and disputes about this Agreement, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The parties will bring any legal suit, action, or proceeding about this Agreement in the **Chosen Courts** and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the **Chosen Courts**.

## 13.4 Injunctive Relief. 
Despite Section 13.3 (Governing Law and Chosen Courts), a breach of Section 11 (Confidentiality) or the violation of a party’s intellectual property rights may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages cannot adequately compensate. As a result, upon the actual or threatened breach of Section 11 (Confidentiality) or violation of a party’s intellectual property rights, the non-breaching or non-violating party may seek appropriate equitable relief, including an injunction, in any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post a bond and without limiting its other rights or remedies.

Except where the Agreement provides for an exclusive remedy, seeking or exercising a remedy does not limit the other rights or remedies available to a party.

## 13.6 Assignment. 
Neither party may assign any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. However, either party may assign this Agreement upon notice if the assigning party undergoes a merger, change of control, reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all its equity, business, or assets to which this Agreement relates. Any attempted but non-permitted assignment is void. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.

There are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

## 13.11 Force Majeure.

## 13.13 Government Rights. 
The Cloud Service and Software are deemed “commercial items” or “commercial computer software” according to FAR section 12.212 and DFAR section 227.7202, and the Documentation is “commercial computer software documentation” according to DFAR section 252.227-7014(a)(1) and (5).

Neither party will take any action that would be a violation of any Applicable Laws that prohibit the offering, giving, promising to offer or give, or receiving, directly or indirectly, money or anything of value to any third party to assist **Provider** or **Customer** in retaining or obtaining business.

# Service Level Agreement

# **Uptime** 

## Target Uptime. **Provider** will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Cloud Service available for at least the **Target Uptime** as calculated each calendar month. 

## Uptime Calculation. **Provider** and **Customer** agree to calculate availability of the Cloud Service as the total number of Available Minutes minus the number of Downtime Minutes, divided by the total number of Available Minutes, measured in a calendar month. If the **Subscription Period** includes a partial month, the numerator and denominator will only include the days that are part of the **Subscription Period** for that month. 

## Scheduling Downtime. If **Provider** does not notify **Customer** about Scheduled Downtime before the **Maintenance** **Notification** **Time**, that period of unavailability will not qualify as Scheduled Downtime and will count as Downtime Minutes. **Provider** may notify **Customer** about Scheduled Downtime by electronic means, including by email, on the Cloud Service, or on **Provider’s** website.

# **Remedies**

## Service Credit. If Cloud Service availability falls below the **Target Uptime**, **Customer** is eligible to receive a **Service Credit**. **Service Credits** only apply towards future Cloud Service fees owed by **Customer** to **Provider** 

## Requesting A Service Credit. To receive a **Service Credit**, **Customer** must notify **Provider** within 7 days of the end of the month where **Customer** experienced Cloud Service unavailability, otherwise **Service Credit** eligibility will expire for that month. **Customer** must include information about when it was unable to access the Cloud Service and may be required to provide additional details about its attempts to access the Cloud Service. If **Provider** can verify Cloud Service unavailability in its internal monitoring systems and the disruption does not qualify as Excluded Minutes or Scheduled Downtime, **Provider** will calculate and issue the applicable **Service Credit** on **Customer’s** account to apply towards a future invoice. 

## Service Credit Limitations. **Service** **Credits** may not be exchanged for, or converted to, monetary amounts. **Service** **Credits** do not earn interest. **Service** **Credits** will not accumulate within a single **Subscription** **Period** in an amount more than 1 months’ worth of Cloud Service fees. However, for **Invoice** **Periods** shorter than one year, **Service** **Credits** will not accumulate within an **Invoice Period** in an amount more than 5% of the Cloud Service fees in that **Invoice Period**. 

## Termination. If the Cloud Service does not meet the **Target** **Uptime** for two (2) out of any three (3) consecutive months and **Customer** notified **Provider** of the failures within 7 days of the end of each impacted month, **Customer** may immediately terminate the affected Order Form by giving written notice to **Provider**. If **Customer** terminates an Order Form under this section, **Provider** will pay to **Customer** a prorated refund of prepaid fees for the remainder of the **Subscription** **Period**.

## Exclusive Remedy. This SLA describes **Customer’s** exclusive remedy and **Provider’s** entire liability for any failure of the Cloud Service to meet the **Target** **Uptime**.

# **Definitions**

## “**Available Minutes**” means the total number of minutes in a calendar month, minus Excluded Minutes and Scheduled Downtime.

## “**Downtime Minutes**” means the total number of minutes in a calendar month when the Cloud Service is not available to **Customer**, as confirmed by **Provider’s** internal monitoring systems, minus Excluded Minutes and Scheduled Downtime.

## “**Excluded Minutes**” means when the Cloud Service is not available because of (a) a Force Majeure Event; (b) general Internet connectivity issues; (c) equipment or software made available by anyone other than **Provider** and that is not within **Provider’s** reasonable control; or (d) **Customer’s** use of the Cloud Service in a manner not authorized by the Agreement.

## “**Scheduled Downtime**” means time periods that occur during the **Maintenance Window** where the Cloud Service is not available to **Customer**.
