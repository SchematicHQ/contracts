the Data Processor. Customer controls the categories of Data Subjects and Personal Data Processed under the Agreement and provides such Personal Data to Provider for business purposes only. Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of the Customer Data and the means by which it acquired the Customer Data.

### 2.  **Data Processing Instructions.** 
This DPA and the Agreement are Customer’s complete and final instructions to Provider for the Processing of Customer Data and the transfer of Customer Data to any country or territory reasonably necessary to provide the Services. Provider and Customer must agree on any additional or alternate instructions. Provider will inform Customer if, in Provider’s opinion, Customer’s instructions violate Data Protection Laws and Regulations. Provider will process Customer Data in accordance with the Agreement (including all documents incorporated in the Agreement), and to comply with other reasonable instructions Customer provides to Provider (including by email) where its instructions are consistent with the Agreement.

### 3.  **CCPA Restrictions.** 
Provider processes Customer Data as a “service provider” under the CCPA. Provider does not sell or share (as those terms are defined in the CCPA) Customer Data with third parties. Provider will not collect, retain, use, or disclose Customer Data, or combine Customer Data with other Personal Data (A) for any purpose other than for the specific business purpose set forth in the Agreement, or (B) outside the direct business relationship between Provider and Customer.

Provider will follow Customer’s instructions to the extent they are technically feasible and legally permissible.

### 2.  **Data Subject Requests**. 
If permitted, Provider will promptly notify Customer of any request from a Data Subject for access to, correction, amendment or deletion of that Data Subject’s Personal Data. Provider will not respond to any Data Subject request without Customer’s prior written consent, except to confirm that the request relates to Customer.

### 3.  **Cooperation and Assistance.** 
Provider will assist Customer to address any request, complaint, notice, or communication Customer receives relating to Provider processing of Customer Data received from (A) a Data Subject whose Personal Data is contained within the Customer Data, or (B) any applicable data protection authority. Provider will also assist Customer with its reasonable requests for information to confirm compliance with this DPA or to conduct a privacy impact assessment.

## 5.  **CUSTOMER PERSONNEL**

### 1.  **Confidentiality.** 
Provider will inform Provider’s personnel engaged in the Processing of Customer Data about the confidential nature of such Customer Data. These personnel receive appropriate training on their responsibilities and are subject to written agreements with confidentiality obligations that survive the termination of their relationship with Provider.

### 2.  **Limitation of Access.** 
Provider ensures that access to Customer Data is limited to those personnel who require access to Process Customer Data under the Agreement.

## 6.  **SUBPROCESSORS**

### 1.  **Authorization.** 
Customer expressly authorizes Provider to use Subprocessors to perform specific services on Provider’s behalf to enable Provider to perform Provider’s obligations under the Agreement. Provider has written agreements with Provider’s Subprocessors that contain obligations substantially similar to Provider’s obligations under this DPA. Provider is liable for any breach of this DPA caused by an act or omission of Provider’s Subprocessors.

### 2.  **Notice and Objection.** 
Provider will notify Customer by email of new Subprocessors before authorizing such Subprocessor(s) to process Customer Data. Customer has a right to reasonably object to Provider’s use of a new Subprocessor by notifying Provider in writing within 10 business days after Provider publish notice of a new Subprocessor. If Customer does so, Provider will use reasonable efforts to change the affected Service, or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer’s configuration or use of the affected Service, to avoid Processing of Customer Data by the new Subprocessor. If Provider are unable to make or recommend such a change within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days, Customer may terminate the subscription term for the Service that Provider cannot provide without using the new Subprocessor. Customer must provide written notice of termination to Provider in accordance with the Agreement. Provider will promptly refund Provider the fees applicable to the unused portion of the subscription term for the terminated Service.

## 7.  **SECURITY AND AUDIT**

### 1.  **Controls for the Protection of Customer Data.** 
Provider maintains appropriate administrative, technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect Customer Data from unauthorized or unlawful Processing, from accidental loss, destruction, or damage (collectively, a “**breach**”). These safeguards are summarized in Exhibit B.

### 2.  **Third-Party Certifications.** 
Provider will provide Customer with a copy any relevant certifications or independent auditor reports upon request.

### 3.  **Incident Management and Breach Notification.** 
Provider will notify Customer within 24 hours of becoming aware of a breach of Customer Data. To the extent known, the notice will include (A) a description of the nature of the Personal Data breach, including the categories and approximate number of Provider’s Data Subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of Provider’s records concerned; (B) the name and contact details of a Customer contact point for more information; (C) the measures Provider is taking to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

### 4.  **Audit Rights.** 
If the information provided in section 7.2 (Third-Party Certifications) is insufficient to reasonably demonstrate Provider’s compliance with Provider’s obligations under this DPA, Provider will provide Customer with additional information - and will allow and contribute to audits, including inspections - reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance. Customer will not exercise this right more than once per year.

### 5.  **Impact Assessments and Consultations.** 
Provider will reasonably cooperate with Customer in connection with any data protection impact assessment or consultation with regulatory authorities that may be required by Data Protection Laws and Regulations.

## 8.  **RETURN AND DELETION OF CUSTOMER DATA**

Upon termination or expiration of Customer’s subscription term, or at
any time upon Customer’s request, Provider will return or destroy all
Customer Data in accordance with the Agreement. If the Services allow
Customer to retrieve Customer Data at any time prior to the end of a
subscription term, then providing this functionality through the
Services during the subscription term satisfies Provider’s obligation to
return Customer Data under this section.

## 9.  **CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS**

To the extent Provider’s processing of Customer Data requires the
transfer of Customer Data from the European Economic Area, the United
Kingdom or Switzerland, to countries that do not ensure an adequate
